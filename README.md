# GRAPHDeep
A comprehensive study of graph deep learning enabled spatial domains discrimination technologies for spatial transcriptomics

Rapid developments in spatially resolved transcriptomes have facilitated the discovery and knowledge of tissue microenvironment and biological function. Recently, graph deep learning has been regarded as a promising methodology to address genetic transcriptomes and spatial locations in spatial omics data. To this end, a comprehensive analytical toolbox, GRAPHDeep, is presented to aggregate two graph deep learning modules (i.e., Variational Graph Auto-Encoder and Deep Graph Infomax) and twenty graph neural networks for spatial domains discrimination. Towards diverse spatial omics data with various modalities and scales, the best integration of graph deep learning module and graph neural network is determined. Consequently, this built framework can be regarded as desirable guidance for choosing an appropriate graph neural network for heterogeneous spatial data. Moreover, the GRAPHDeep is easily scalable in graph deep learning modules, neural networks, and spatial data, enabling it to provide novel possibilities in the downstream analysis of spatial omics data.
